# T.cacao_selective_sweeps

The following repository contains additional tables and figures from Nelson et al. (In Review) (Selective sweeps within T. cacao).
This repository contains three different directories.....

## /files_for_scans
This directory contains the script and input files needed to create the selection scans from ICS data for each population.

## /PCA_Correlations
This directory contains two .html files that contain different correlation matrices for our climatic and edaphic variables.

## /T.cacao_Enrichments
This directory contains one file that lists all of the enrichented Gene Ontologies within selective sweep regions. The file also includes the P-value, FDR, and the population in which the enrichment was detected.

## /ICS_genes
Contains a complete list of gene names that wre identified as selective sweeps from our composite analysis.

## /GEA_genes
Contains a complete list of genes that contained SNPs that were significantly associated with at least one climate or edaphic variable. 

## /GEA_ICS_genes
Contains a complete list of genes that contained SNPs that were significantly associated with at least one climate or edaphic variable and identified as an outlier from our composite analysis.

## /R_Genes_ICS
Contains a complete list of all of the disease resistant genes that were identified in sweep regions from our composite analysis.
